Typography
Standardise: Use clean, technical sans-serifs or monospaced fonts that evoke analogue instrumentation and printed manuals.

No "Future" Fonts: Avoid anything decorative or stylised. Focus strictly on high legibility and utilitarian letterforms.

Functional Scaling: Emphasise critical data points (like percentages or metrics) with significantly larger scales, keeping secondary labels small, uniform, and tightly kerned.

Colour
Kill the Gradient: Strictly flat colours. Absolutely no gradients, colour blending, or shading.

Natural Palettes: Stick to a monochromatic, low-contrast base (such as muted sage, beige, or off-white) paired with stark black or dark grey for all text, lines, and UI elements.

Purposeful Accents: Rely on stark contrast, typography weight, and line thickness rather than bright colours to indicate active states or hierarchy.

Layout
Increase Density: Organise information logically within clearly defined, compartmentalised zones.

Strict Grids: Employ visible 1px borders to separate navigation tabs, control modules, and analytics. Everything must align to a rigid, mathematical grid.

Utility First: Design sections to resemble a technical dashboard or engineering schematic; form strictly follows function.

Texture
Remove Glassmorphism: Backgrounds must remain completely solid, opaque, and matte.

Flat Surfaces: Use 1px dark borders to define containers, drop-downs, and buttons instead of varying background shades or fills.

No Glows: Strip out all lighting effects. The interface should feel as though it is printed directly onto paper or etched into a physical surface.

Visuals
No Emojis: Use stark, technical vector line-art for all illustrations (such as the wireframe pendant lamp).

Authenticity: Replace standard digital illustrations with raw data visualisations, precise circular dials, bar charts, and literal tick marks.

Icon Clarity: Use minimalist, un-filled, thin-stroke icons that precisely match the weight of the UI typography and structural borders.

Shadows
Hard Edges: Eliminate all shadows entirely. Use solid line strokes to define boundaries, interactive elements, and hierarchy.

Layering: Rely strictly on structural layout and borders rather than overlapping elements to establish order.

Consistency: The interface must remain aggressively two-dimensional, evoking a physical, mechanical control panel rather than floating digital layers.
